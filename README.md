## Responsive Travel Agency Page with React

### Today I designed a travel agency page using React and react libraries.
### When we first open our site, we see a fixed navbar and hero section. When we switch between pages, our links remain active. There are several popular places on the homepage and below are the latest trips. The About page contains information about the company. The service page contains the services offered by the company. At the same time, when switching between pages, our page scrolls at the top.On the contact page, we come across a forum and methods of communicating. 
### Each of our forum inputs is set as a required field and I have set notifications. There are minimum and maximum character limits, and when we submit, it prints our information to the console screen. If the required requirements are not met, our form does not submit.
