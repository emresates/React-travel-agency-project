        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <div className="about-row-reverse">
          <p className="p2">
            Like you, we had no idea who to trust for travel advice. That’s why
            we made Trippy, a travel site written by real experts, not anonymous
            reviewers. Our writers are locals with hometown pride, parents who
            are road trip heroes, cruise junkies who know every ship at sea, and
            virtually everyone else in-between. As one of the top-10 travel
            information sites in the world as measured by comScore, a leading
            Internet measurement company, we have more than 50 writers—from
            lifetime locals to licensed tour guides—sharing useful travel advice
            and inspiration from destinations around the world. Trippy has been
            honored by multiple awards since its inception, including the Eppy
            Awards, the W3 Awards, and the Communicator Awards. You’ll find that
            our 30-year-strong library of more than 30,000 articles will make
            you a savvy traveler—showing you how to book a hotel the whole
            family will love, where to find the best bagel in New York City, and
            how to skip the lines at theme parks. We give you the confidence to
            spend your vacation actually vacationing, not fumbling with a
            guidebook or second-guessing yourself. Here are three principles
            that guide our coverage:
            <br />
            <b>Accuracy and integrity:</b>
            We rigorously vet and update each article on the site using our
            staff and an army of freelance travel editors. Additionally, we
            don’t accept payment in exchange for coverage, ensuring that the
            places we write about and recommend are actually as cool as we say
            they are.
            <br />
            <b>Cultivated recommendations: </b>
            We don’t just recommend everything—we only recommend the best.
            Unlike overwhelming review sites, our writers use their local
            knowledge to suggest the places that are worth your time, whether
            you’re traveling for a business trip or family vacation.
            <br />
            <b>Expertise: </b>
            Most of our writers live and work every day in the destinations they
            write about. They can tell you how to catch the bus, where to find
            the best croissant and everything in between. TripSavvy, vacation
            like a pro.

        <h2>Editorial Guidelines</h2>
        <div className="about-row">
          <p>
            Our in-house editorial staff oversees every article on our site. We
            aim to provide a thorough library of travel content that lets
            travelers find inspiration, plan their trips, and give them valuable
            guidance once they are on the ground. Unlike many popular travel
            sites which rely on writers “parachuting” in to produce single
            stories, most of our writers are experts in their particular
            destinations and topics—they know everything from the best beaches,
            bars, and boutiques, to the best luggage to buy and the apps you
            must download before you go. We add relevant links to our content
            that may help you further your knowledge or enrich your planning
            about a specific destination.
            <br />
            <span>QUALITY STANDARDS:</span>
            The world changes every day, and your travel guide should, too. Our
            editors review our text, images, and illustrations before publishing
            to make sure that our articles are accurate and of the highest
            quality. Once a story has been published, we have a stable of
            experienced freelance editors responsible for fact-checking and
            updating our content library, regularly ensuring that every piece of
            content on the site informs, is accurate, and is free of ethical
            concerns, conflicts, or misinformation. Spot something out of date?
            Let us know by emailing us at contact@trippy.com.
            <br />
            <span>ETHICS:</span>
            Like many other travel publications, Trippy editors and select
            contributors often work with tourism boards, tour operators, brands,
            and hotel properties to support our coverage. In an era when many
            independent media outlets are struggling to survive, this is one way
            to support our writers when they are on the road and allow them to
            have firsthand access to locations and experiences that are
            otherwise cost-prohibitive. These experiences enable Trippy to
            produce robust, thoroughly-researched stories that present a broad
            overview of a destination. With that, we do not cover any
            destinations, restaurants, hotels, or tours that we wouldn’t
            personally recommend.
            <br />
            <span>DIVERSITY & INCLUSION:</span>
            Trippy’s mission, vacation like a pro, includes everyone. It’s our
            responsibility as a travel site to speak out about the
            discrimination and injustices that people of color face every day,
            not only while traveling but also while at home or in their own
            neighborhoods. Things need to change, and we are committed to doing
            our part to fight systemic racism and oppression through our
            content. We want everyone to feel at home in the world; we will use
            our platform to spread a message of inclusivity, equality, and human
            rights across the globe by sharing diverse voices, promoting unique
            businesses. We are actively listening and learning every day how we
            can better cater to our diverse community of readers.

            <p>
              Each year, Trippy editors award the best restaurants, hotels, and
              attractions around the world. To select winners, our team of data
              engineers identified more than 60,000 recommended hotels,
              restaurants, and attractions within Trippy’s 30,000 travel advice
              articles, then created an aggregated, weighted star score (1-5)
              for each business based on key data points:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Star ratings from top review sites</li>
              <li>The authority of those rating sites</li>
              <li>Trippy audience data</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Any business that scored higher than 4.2 was passed on to editors
              for consideration. Our team of 50+ editors and writers based
              around the world hand-reviewed businesses based on several
              factors:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Category fit:</b>
                Does the business genuinely represent the best of its category?
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Reader behavior:</b>
                How much time do Trippy users spend reading about this business,
                posting about it on social media, or returning to the article?
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Newsworthiness: </b>
                Is the business or destination in the spotlight this year?
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>In-person experience:</b>
                What is this business like in real life? Does it live up to its
                expectations, or would it be a waste of a traveler’s time?
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Editors made the ultimate decision for each award winner, taking
              into consideration all of the above factors.
