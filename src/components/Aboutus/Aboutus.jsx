        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
          Like you, we had no idea who to trust for travel advice. That’s why we
          made Trippy, a travel site written by real experts, not anonymous
          reviewers. Our writers are locals with hometown pride, parents who are
          road trip heroes, cruise junkies who know every ship at sea, and
          virtually everyone else in-between. As one of the top-10 travel
          information sites in the world as measured by comScore, a leading
          Internet measurement company, we have more than 50 writers—from
          lifetime locals to licensed tour guides—sharing useful travel advice
          and inspiration from destinations around the world. Trippy has been
          honored by multiple awards since its inception, including the Eppy
          Awards, the W3 Awards, and the Communicator Awards. You’ll find that
          our 20-year-strong library of more than 30,000 articles will make you
          a savvy traveler—showing you how to book a hotel the whole family will
          love, where to find the best bagel in New York City, and how to skip
          the lines at theme parks. We give you the confidence to spend your
          vacation actually vacationing, not fumbling with a guidebook or
          second-guessing yourself. Here are three principles that guide our
          coverage:
          <br />
          <b>Accuracy and integrity:</b>
          We rigorously vet and update each article on the site using our staff
          and an army of freelance travel editors. Additionally, we don’t accept
          payment in exchange for coverage, ensuring that the places we write
          about and recommend are actually as cool as we say they are.
          <br />
          <b>Cultivated recommendations: </b>
          We don’t just recommend everything—we only recommend the best. Unlike
          overwhelming review sites, our writers use their local knowledge to
          suggest the places that are worth your time, whether you’re traveling
          for a business trip or family vacation.
          <br />
          <b>Expertise: </b>
          Most of our writers live and work every day in the destinations they
          write about. They can tell you how to catch the bus, where to find the
          best croissant and everything in between. TripSavvy, vacation like a
          pro.
        </p>

        <h1>Editorial Guidelines</h1>
        <p>
          Our in-house editorial staff oversees every article on our site. We
          aim to provide a thorough library of travel content that lets
          travelers find inspiration, plan their trips, and give them valuable
          guidance once they are on the ground. Unlike many popular travel sites
          which rely on writers “parachuting” in to produce single stories, most
          of our writers are experts in their particular destinations and
          topics—they know everything from the best beaches, bars, and
          boutiques, to the best luggage to buy and the apps you must download
          before you go. We add relevant links to our content that may help you
          further your knowledge or enrich your planning about a specific
          destination. Occasionally, we link to outside websites if they’re
          relevant to the story, especially in the case of directing readers to
          businesses, or products that we have tested and recommend.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>QUALITY STANDARDS</span>
          The world changes every day, and your travel guide should, too. Our
          editors review our text, images, and illustrations before publishing
          to make sure that our articles are accurate and of the highest
          quality. Once a story has been published, we have a stable of
          experienced freelance editors responsible for fact-checking and
          updating our content library, regularly ensuring that every piece of
          content on the site informs, is accurate, and is free of ethical
          concerns, conflicts, or misinformation. Spot something out of date?
          Let us know by emailing us at contact@trippy.com. In addition to our
          editors, our team also consists of visual editors and illustrators, as
          well as product managers, designers, and engineers monitor who monitor
          the usage of our sites, per our Privacy Policy, to improve your
          experience across all devices and develop new features.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>ETHICS</span>
          Like many other travel publications, Trippy editors and select
          contributors often work with tourism boards, tour operators, brands,
          and hotel properties to support our coverage. In an era when many
          independent media outlets are struggling to survive, this is one way
          to support our writers when they are on the road and allow them to
          have firsthand access to locations and experiences that are otherwise
          cost-prohibitive. These experiences enable Trippy to produce robust,
          thoroughly-researched stories that present a broad overview of a
          destination. With that, we do not cover any destinations, restaurants,
          hotels, or tours that we wouldn’t personally recommend. Furthermore,
          we do not accept monetary compensation in exchange for coverage. Our
          experts and contributors are required to abide by the FTC disclosure
          guidelines.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Diversity & Inclusion</span>
          Trippy’s mission, vacation like a pro, includes everyone. It’s our
          responsibility as a travel site to speak out about the discrimination
          and injustices that people of color face every day, not only while
          traveling but also while at home or in their own neighborhoods. Things
          need to change, and we are committed to doing our part to fight
          systemic racism and oppression through our content. We want everyone
          to feel at home in the world; we will use our platform to spread a
          message of inclusivity, equality, and human rights across the globe by
          sharing diverse voices, promoting unique businesses, and adequately
          addressing that the travel experience might be different for Black
          travelers and those from historically marginalized communities. We are
          actively listening and learning every day how we can better cater to
          our diverse community of readers. For our full diversity pledge, click
          here.

          <span> About the TripSavvy Editors’ Choice Awards</span>
          Each year, Trippy editors award the best restaurants, hotels, and
          attractions around the world. To select winners, our team of data
          engineers identified more than 60,000 recommended hotels, restaurants,
          and attractions within TripSavvy’s 30,000 travel advice articles, then
          created an aggregated, weighted star score (1-5) for each business
          based on key data points: Star ratings from top review sites The
          authority of those rating sites Trippy audience data Any business that
          scored higher than 4.2 was passed on to editors for consideration. Our
          team of 50+ editors and writers based around the world hand-reviewed
          businesses based on several factors:
          <br />
          <b>Category fit:</b>
          Does the business genuinely represent the best of its category?
          <br />
          <b>Reader behavior:</b>
          How much time do Trippy users spend reading about this business,
          posting about it on social media, or returning to the article?
          <br />
          <b>Newsworthiness: </b>
          Is the business or destination in the spotlight this year?
          <br />
          <b>In-person experience:</b>
          What is this business like in real life? Does it live up to its
          expectations, or would it be a waste of a traveler’s time? Editors
          made the ultimate decision for each award winner, taking into
          consideration all of the above factors.
